# Introduction

_Building Modern Applications with GraphQL_

In this workshop, we will introduce you to GraphQL and the major concepts behind it. We will look at how to build a GraphQL server with ASP.NET core 6 and Hot Chocolate. You will learn how to query GraphQL and what tools are out there that can help you explore and manage large schemas. Further, we will dive into React and explore how to efficiently build fast and fluent web interfaces using the JavaScript client Relay.

**Technologies covered**: .NET 6, ASP.NET Core 6, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Hot Chocolate, Relay
