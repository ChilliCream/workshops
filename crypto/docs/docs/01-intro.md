# Introduction

_Building Modern Applications with GraphQL_

In this workshop, we’ll introduce you to GraphQL and the major concepts behind it. We’ll look at how to build a GraphQL server with ASP.NET core 6 and Hot Chocolate. You’ll learn how to query GraphQL and what tools are out there that can help you explore and manage large schemas. Further, we’ll dive into React and explore how to efficiently build fast and fluent web interfaces using the JavaScript client Relay.

**Technologies covered**: .NET 6, ASP.NET Core 6, TypeScript, React, GraphQL, Hot Chocolate, Relay

## Bootcamp

### Start from Zero

The most common way to start any programming course is to display the text “Hello, World!”. Continuing with this tradition, we’ll use _GraphQL & friends_ to display the famous text.

### Crypto App

We’ll develop step-by-step a full crypto app to learn everything there is to know about data-driven applications that operate on a diverse set of data pulled from different sources, often in real-time.
