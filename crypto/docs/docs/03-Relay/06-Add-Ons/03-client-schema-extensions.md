# Client Schema Extensions

Relay can be used to read and write local data, and act as a single source of truth for _all_ data in your client application.

Client schema extensions allows you to modify existing types on the schema (e.g., by adding new fields to a type), or to create entirely new types that only exist in the client.

For more information, read the docs [here](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/client-schema-extensions/) and [here](https://relay.dev/docs/guided-tour/updating-data/client-only-data/).
