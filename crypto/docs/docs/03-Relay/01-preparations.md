# Preparations

Thousands of products now use GraphQL APIs. Even companies like Github have a public GraphQL API.

GraphQL has proven itself to be a strong choice when building frontend apps. They just scale and it often makes the code more readable and maintainable.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, bear in mind that we assume some level of familiarity with:

- [Javascript](https://felix-kling.de/jsbasics/)

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)

## Something else?

- Check if you have already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 16.10 or higher:

  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

  Otherwise you'll need to install it, [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- Check if you have already installed [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

  ```sh
  yarn -v
  ```

  Otherwise you'll need to install it, [Yarn Modern](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install):

  ```sh
  corepack enable
  ```

- You'll need to have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or similar IDE.
