# Sorting and Filtering

In this last part of creating the backend for our price ticker, we want to give the consumer of our API the power to filter and sort assets. We now return the assets sorted by the asset`s symbol field by default.

```csharp
[UsePaging]
public IQueryable<Asset> GetAssets(AssetContext context)
    => context.Assets.OrderBy(t => t.Symbol);
```

But in our frontend component for the ticker, we want to sort the assets by the `tradableMarketCapRank`. Further, we also want to introduce UI components that allow sorting of the assets in lists. **Hot Chocolate** comes with integrations for many data sources to rewrite exposed filters and the sort order into the native query language.

In our case, we want to apply these custom filters and sort orders onto the returned `IQueryable<Asset>`, like we did with the paging. While paging is actually built into the core of **Hot Chocolate**, the data integrations like sorting and filtering come with the `HotChocolate.Data.*` packages. We have already added the `HotChocolate.Data.EntityFramework` package to the current project.

## Configuration

Before we can start using the filter and sorting middleware, we need to register the features with the GraphQL configuration builder, which will apply the required services and conventions to the GraphQL schema and executor.

Head over to the `Program.cs`. Chain `AddFiltering()` and `AddSorting()` into the GraphQL configuration.

```graphql
builder.Services
    .AddGraphQLServer()
    .AddQueryType<Query>()
    .AddAssetTypes()
    .AddGlobalObjectIdentification()
    .AddFiltering()
    .AddSorting()
    .RegisterDbContext<AssetContext>(DbContextKind.Pooled);
```

Your Program.cs should now look like the following.

```csharp title="/Program.cs"
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services
    .AddHttpContextAccessor()
    .AddCors()
    .AddHelperServices();

builder.Services
    .AddPooledDbContextFactory<AssetContext>(o => o.UseSqlite("Data Source=assets.db"));

builder.Services
    .AddGraphQLServer()
    .AddQueryType<Query>()
    .AddAssetTypes()
    .AddGlobalObjectIdentification()
    .AddFiltering()
    .AddSorting()
    .RegisterDbContext<AssetContext>(DbContextKind.Pooled);

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseCors(c => c.AllowAnyHeader().AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyOrigin());
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.MapGraphQL();

app.Run();
```

## Middleware

The attribute `UsePagingAttribute` is a so called `DescriptorAttribute` that wraps GraphQL fluent configuration logic.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// This attribute adds the cursor paging middleware to the annotated method or property.
/// </summary>
public sealed class UsePagingAttribute : DescriptorAttribute
{
    // shortened for brevity

    protected internal override void TryConfigure(
        IDescriptorContext context,
        IDescriptor descriptor,
        ICustomAttributeProvider element)
    {
        if (element is MemberInfo)
        {
            if (descriptor is IObjectFieldDescriptor ofd)
            {
                ofd.UsePaging()
            }
            else if (descriptor is IInterfaceFieldDescriptor ifd)
            {
                ifd.UsePaging()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Annotating our resolver with this attribute, we will lead to intercepting the field descriptor and applying the configuration to it. Attributes that start with the verb `Use` will apply field middleware, changing the runtime behavior of the annotated resolver.

:::info

**Hot Chocolate** allows you to define your schema with three equally capable approaches.

- **annotation-based**

  The annotation-based approach uses pure C# code in combination with attributes. Most of the types in this workshop leverage this approach.

- **code-first**

  The code-first approach uses our fluent type API to declare types.

  ```csharp
  public sealed class AssetFilterInputType : FilterInputType<Asset>
  {
      protected override void Configure(IFilterInputTypeDescriptor<Asset> descriptor)
      {
          descriptor.BindFieldsExplicitly();
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Symbol);
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Slug);
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Name);
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Description);
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Website);
          descriptor.Field(t => t.Price);
      }
  }
  ```

- **schema-first**
  
  The schema-first approach leverages the GraphQL schema definition language to declare the schema types. The first version of **Hot Chocolate** was actually a schema-first-only server.

  ```graphql
  type Query {
      assets: [Asset!]!
  }
  ```

Schema building approaches can be mixed and matched.

:::

For **field middleware attributes, the order is important** since they will form a field resolver pipeline.

<img src="/img/backend/example2-middleware-2.png" width="500" />

:::note

The descriptor API is open, and you can build your own descriptor attributes that you can chain into any field middleware pipeline. In middleware attributes, make sure to pass through the `order` parameter.

```csharp
public sealed class UsePagingAttribute : DescriptorAttribute
{
    // shortened for brevity
    public UsePagingAttribute([CallerLineNumber] int order = 0)
    {
        Order = order;
    }
}
```

:::

:::info

A field middleware can be applied to an `IObjectTypeDescriptor` with the fluent API.

```csharp
public sealed class AssetPriceChangeType : ObjectType
{
    protected override void Configure(IObjectTypeDescriptor descriptor)
    {
        descriptor
            .Field("somefield")
            .Use(next => context => 
            {
                await next(context);
                
                if(context.Result is string s) 
                {
                    context.Result = s.ToUpper();
                }
            })
            .Resolve(ctx => "hello");
    }
}
```

:::

## Resolver

Now that we understand what field middleware is and how we can leverage it to change execution behavior, let's do that by adding the filtering and sorting middleware to our `GetAssets` resolver.

Head over to the `Query.cs` file located in the `Types` directory and add the `UseFiltering` and `UseSorting` attributes.

```csharp
[UsePaging]
[UseFiltering]
[UseSorting]
public IQueryable<Asset> GetAssets(AssetContext context)
    => context.Assets.OrderBy(t => t.Symbol);
```

We will have the following pipeline structure with our resolver annotated like above.

<img src="/img/backend/example2-middleware-3.png" width="700" />

Let`s look at what our schema looks like with these changes.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open http://localhost:5000/graphql and refresh your schema.

![Banana Cake Pop - Refresh Schema](../images/example2-part1-bcp1.png)

Next, let's head over to the `Schema Reference` tab to inspect the new schema.

![Banana Cake Pop - Refresh Schema](../images/example2-part1-bcp4.png)

Our assets field now has two more arguments called `where` and `order`, which are input objects.

Now, click on the order type and let us explore the type structure.

![Banana Cake Pop - Refresh Schema](../images/example2-part1-bcp5.png)

We can see that we can order by all the fields on our `Asset` and `AssetPrice` type; we can even order by the `description` field, which makes little sense.

:::important

When we allow the consumer to filter on any field and/or sort by and field, we no longer are in control over how our resolver will perform. This has security and performance implications, e.g. you probably want to make sure that all fields, that can be used for sorting and filtering, have an index defined in a relational database. Ensure that you only expose fields to the filter and/or sorting middleware that you really need.

The data package allows you to control what fields are filterable or sortable and what filter or sort operations are permitted on the fields.

:::

Before we start writing queries with custom sort orders or filters, let us go back to the code and remove fields that we do not need to expose for filtering and sorting.

Create a new file `AssetFilterInputType.cs` located in the `Types` directory.

```csharp title="/Types/AssetFilterInputType.cs"
using HotChocolate.Data.Filters;

namespace Demo.Types;

public sealed class AssetFilterInputType : FilterInputType<Asset>
{
    protected override void Configure(IFilterInputTypeDescriptor<Asset> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.BindFieldsExplicitly();
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Symbol);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Slug);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Name);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Price);
    }
}
```

Next, head over to the file `Query.cs` and pass in the `AssetFilterInputType` type to the `UseFiltering` attribute.

```csharp
[UseFiltering(typeof(AssetFilterInputType))]
```

With the filtering configured, we still need to configure our sorting middleware.

Create a new file `AssetSortInputType.cs` located in the `Types` directory.

```csharp title="/Types/AssetSortInputType.cs"
using HotChocolate.Data.Sorting;

namespace Demo.Types;

public sealed class AssetSortInputType : SortInputType<Asset>
{
    protected override void Configure(ISortInputTypeDescriptor<Asset> descriptor)
    {
        descriptor.BindFieldsExplicitly();
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Symbol);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Slug);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Name);
        descriptor.Field(t => t.Price);
    }
}
```

As for filtering, we need to pass the `AssetSortInputType` type into the filtering middleware.

```csharp
[UseSorting(typeof(AssetSortInputType))]
```

Last but not least, we need to refine our resolver a bit so that we apply the default order only to our `IQueryable` if no sort order was specified.

```csharp
[UsePaging]
[UseFiltering(typeof(AssetFilterInputType))]
[UseSorting(typeof(AssetSortInputType))]
public IQueryable<Asset> GetAssets(AssetContext context, IResolverContext resolverContext)
    => resolverContext.ArgumentLiteral<IValueNode>("order").Kind is SyntaxKind.NullValue
        ? context.Assets.OrderBy(t => t.Symbol)
        : context.Assets;
```

Now, let's test how we can filter and sort our dataset.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open http://localhost:5000/graphql and refresh your schema.

![Banana Cake Pop - Refresh Schema](../images/example2-part1-bcp1.png)

Check that we now only expose the fields defined in our types.

```graphql
query {
  assets(
    where: { price: { tradableMarketCapRank: { gt: 163 } } }
    order: { price: { tradableMarketCapRank: DESC } }
  ) {
    nodes {
      name
      price {
        tradableMarketCapRank
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "assets": {
      "nodes": [
        {
          "name": "Wrapped LUNA Token",
          "price": {
            "tradableMarketCapRank": 166
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Orca",
          "price": {
            "tradableMarketCapRank": 165
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "Kyber Network",
          "price": {
            "tradableMarketCapRank": 164
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

Note that it is possible to filter and sort not only by the root element of the query, but also by elements of child collections.

:::

## Field Bindings

Before wrapping up this last part of our chapter, we need to add one more thing to our `Asset` type. As of now, the `Asset` exposes an image key that the UI cannot leverage to fetch the `Asset` icon.

We need to rewrite this file to expose a URL for that image. For this, we will add a new resolver to our `AssetNode` class.


```csharp
[BindMember(nameof(Asset.ImageKey))]
public string? GetImageUrl([Parent] Asset asset, [Service] IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
{
    if (asset.ImageKey is null)
    {
        return null;
    }

    string? scheme = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.Request.Scheme;
    string? host = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.Request.Host.Value;
    if (scheme is null || host is null)
    {
        return null;
    }

    return $"{scheme}://{host}/images/{asset.ImageKey}";
}
```

The above resolver is annotated with the `BindMember` attribute. This instruct the schema builder to replace a field with a different name with this resolver. The new field name will become `imageUrl` instead of `imageKey`.

The completed file should look like the following.

```csharp title="/Types/AssetNode.cs"
namespace Demo.Types;

[Node]
[ExtendObjectType(typeof(Asset))]
public sealed class AssetNode
{
    public async Task<AssetPrice> GetPriceAsync(
        [Parent] Asset asset,
        AssetPriceBySymbolDataLoader priceBySymbol,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        => await priceBySymbol.LoadAsync(asset.Symbol!, cancellationToken);

    [BindMember(nameof(Asset.ImageKey))]
    public string? GetImageUrl([Parent] Asset asset, [Service] IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
    {
        if (asset.ImageKey is null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        string? scheme = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.Request.Scheme;
        string? host = httpContextAccessor.HttpContext?.Request.Host.Value;
        if (scheme is null || host is null)
        {
            return null;
        }

        return $"{scheme}://{host}/images/{asset.ImageKey}";
    }

    [NodeResolver]
    public static async Task<Asset> GetByIdAsync(
        int id, 
        AssetByIdDataLoader assetById,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        => await assetById.LoadAsync(id, cancellationToken);
}
```

Lets quickly test this new field with **Banana Cake Pop**.

```bash
dotnet run
```

Open http://localhost:5000/graphql and refresh your schema.

![Banana Cake Pop - Refresh Schema](../images/example2-part1-bcp1.png)

Now, execute the following query and ensure that you can load the images.

```graphql
query {
  assets {
    nodes {
      imageUrl
    }
  }
}

```

## Summary

In the last part of this chapter, we explored what field middleware is and how it enables the paging, filtering, and sorting capabilities of **Hot Chocolate**. We extended our `assets` field to allow custom filtering and sorting by the user. We also learned that it's best not to expose all the fields to the consumer for performance and security reasons.
